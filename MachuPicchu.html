                For many visitors to Peru and even South America, a visit to the Inca city of Machu Picchu is the long-anticipated highpoint of their trip. <br />
                In a spectacular location, it’s the best-known archaeological site on the continent. This awe-inspiring ancient city was never revealed to the conquering Spaniards <br />
                and was virtually forgotten until the early part of the 20th century. In the high season, from late May until early September, 2500 people arrive daily. <br /><br />
                Despite this great tourist influx, the site manages to retain an air of grandeur and mystery, and is a must for all visitors to Peru. <br />
                The site is most heavily visited between 10am and 2pm. June through August are the busiest months.

            Few romances can ever surpass that of the granite citadel on top of the beetling precipices of Machu Picchu - crown of the Inca Land. <br />
            In the variety of its charms and the power of its spell, I know of no other place in the world which can compare to it.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
            Tucked away in the rocky countryside northwest of Cusco, Peru, Machu Picchu is an Incan citadel set high in the Andes Mountains, above the Urubamba River valley. <br />           
            Built in the 15th century at the peak of the Incan Empire, it was later abandoned when the Incan civilization was virtually wiped out by Spanish invaders in the 16th century. <br />
            For hundreds of years, until the American archaeologist Hiram Bingham stumbled upon it in 1911, the abandoned citadel’s existence was a secret known only to peasants living in the region.          
        </p>
        <p>
            Featuring intriguing buildings that play on astronomical alignments, panoramic views and sophisticated dry-stone walls that fuse huge blocks without the use of mortar, <br />
            the site stretches over an impressive 5-mile distance, featuring more than 3,000 stone steps that link its many different levels. <br />
            Today, hundreds of thousands of people tramp through Machu Picchu every year, braving crowds and landslides <br />
            to see the sun set over its towering stone monuments and marvel at the mysterious splendor of one of the world’s most famous manmade wonders. <br />
            As of today, Machu Picchu's exact former use remains a mystery.

                                        Due to the Spanish Invasion of Peru, most cities built by the Incas were destroyed. <br />
                                        Miraculously, as Machu Picchu was so well-hidden, it was not discovered by the Spaniards, <br />
                                        thus this archeological gem still exists in present day.

                                        Twice a year, the sun sits directly over the stone creating no shadow.
