                Taj Mahal was built by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in the memory of his wife Arjumand Bano Begum, also known as Mumtaz Mahal. THe construction of this beautiful white monument was started in year 1631.
                There were about 22,000 workers and 1,000 elephants who took part in the contruction and was finished building in 1653, after 22 years. Taj Mahal is one of the Seven Wonders of the World an has been enlisted as a UNESCO World Heritage site.
                <br />There also has been rumours that the Emperor Shah Jahan had ordered his trusted men, to cut off the hands of the 22,000 workers who built the site to ensure that no other of its kind would be built.
                    Currently, there is a rough estimate of 3 million people visiting the Taj Mahal annually. Which also means that with the modern world, there is much more air pollution compared to the past, this poses a threat to the
                    complex because the white marbled building is being deriorated.</td>
